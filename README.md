--------------------

Draft.js is a JavaScript rich text editor framework, built for React and
backed by an immutable model.

- **Extensible and Customizable:** We provide the building blocks to enable
the creation of a broad variety of rich text composition experiences, from
basic text styles to embedded media.
- **Declarative Rich Text:** Draft.js fits seamlessly into
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) applications,
abstracting away the details of rendering, selection, and input behavior with a
familiar declarative API.
- **Immutable Editor State:** The Draft.js model is built
with [immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), offering
an API with functional state updates and aggressively leveraging data persistence
for scalable memory usage.

[Learn how to use Draft.js in your own project.](https://draftjs.org/docs/getting-started/)

Draft.js is used in production on Facebook, including status and
comment inputs, [Notes](https://www.facebook.com/notes/), and
[messenger.com](https://www.messenger.com).

## API Notice

Before getting started, please be aware that we recently changed the API of
Entity storage in Draft. 

Previously, the old API was set to be removed in `v0.11.0`. Since, the plans have changedâ€” `v0.11.0` still supports the old API and `v0.12.0` will remove it. Refer to [the docs](https://draftjs.org/docs/v0-10-api-migration) for more information and information on how to migrate.

## Getting Started

```
npm install --save draft-js react react-dom

or

yarn add draft-js react react-dom
```

Draft.js depends on React and React DOM which must also be installed.

### Using Draft.js

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import {Editor, EditorState} from 'draft-js';

function MyEditor() {

  
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {editorState: EditorState.createEmpty()};
    this.onChange = (editorState) => this.setState({editorState});
    this.setEditor = (editor) => {
      this.editor = editor;
    };
    this.focusEditor = () => {
      if (this.editor) {
        this.editor.focus();
      }
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.focusEditor();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div style={styles.editor} onClick={this.focusEditor}>
        <Editor
          ref={this.setEditor}
          editorState={this.state.editorState}
          onChange={this.onChange}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const styles = {
  editor: {
    border: '1px solid gray',
    minHeight: '6em'
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyEditor />,
  document.getElementById('container')
);
```

Since the release of React 16.8, you can use [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) as a way to work with `EditorState` without using a class.


```js
import React from "react";
import { Editor, EditorState } from "draft-js";
import "draft-js/dist/Draft.css";

export default function MyEditor() {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = React.useState(() =>
    EditorState.createEmpty()
  );

  const editor = React.useRef(null);
  function focusEditor() {
    editor.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <div
      style={{ border: "1px solid black", minHeight: "6em", cursor: "text" }}
      onClick={focusEditor}
    >
      <Editor
        ref={editor}
        editorState={editorState}
        onChange={setEditorState}
        placeholder="Write something!"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

```

Note that the editor itself is only as tall as its contents. In order to give users a visual cue, we recommend setting a border and a minimum height via the `.DraftEditor-root` CSS selector, or using a wrapper div like in the above example.

Because Draft.js supports unicode, you must have the following meta tag in the `<head>` `</head>` block of your HTML file:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />
```

Further examples of how Draft.js can be used are provided in the `/examples` directory of this repo.

### Building Draft.js

Draft.js is built with [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) v1. Using other package managers might work, but is not officially supported.

To clone and build, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/facebook/draft-js.git
cd draft-js
yarn install
yarn run build
```

### Examples

To run the examples in the `/examples` directory, first build Draft.js locally as described above. Then, open the example HTML files in your browser.
